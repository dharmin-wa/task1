# User login/register application

This is a test project to demonstrate using Intern with Angular, ngrx and api calling. 

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dharmin-wa/Task1.git
cd Task1
cd user-GDPR-FE
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
